### A simple replay steps#

We leverage aflnet-replay to reproduce protocol bugs. aflnet-replay is a client that can send messages given to servers.

1. compile aflnet-replay with the following commands and then aflnet-replay appears.
	cd replay && make

2. open tested servers, for TinyDTLS like:
   ./tests/dtls-server
   
3. send packers to servers, for TinyDTLS like:
   ./aflnet-replay ../illegMemAccess.raw DTLS12 20220
	
After that, the tested servers are crashed with given packets illegMemAccess.raw.
